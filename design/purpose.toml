The purpose of these documents is to lay out the design for a rust embedded
ecosystem from the top down. The end goal is to create a turly revolutionary
embedded development experience by utilizing a safe language (rust) combined
with zero-cost libraries with well design APIs which all *work together*.

The intent is not to tell other developers how they should design their
embedded APIs, but rather to help diagnose the areas in rust's embedded
development story that needs further work.

These design documents will be split into three sections: 
- (REQ) requirements: this is the libraries we *want* at a high level.
  This lays out the various layers ([[REQ-layers]]) of abstraction that the
  ecosystem should provide to make programming on microcontrollers safe,
  productive and enjoyable.
- (SPC) specifications: these will link to a REQ and will lay out a rough
  high level API/s for how to accomplish the requirement, as well as
  provide links to existing libraries and discuss their pros and cons.
- (TST) tests: will discuss tools and methodologies for testing the various
  suggested implementations of the ecosystem

Next:
- [[REQ-layers]]: the dependency layer structure this ecosystem aims to achieve

[REQ-layers]

Many people think of microcontrollers as only "low level" programming. This
is not accurate, as a huge amount of abstraction is possible with APIs that
are designed to be zero cost. Rust makes it easy to design such APIs while
still maintaining memory and data race safety.

The rust-embedded design shall follow the following layers, from high level
to low level:

```
Layer 1:
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     Application                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Layer 2:   ^                ^        ^              ^               ^
+-------------------+ +-----------+  ^  +------------------------+ +--------------+ 
| Communication     | | Board API |  ^  | Data Types / Functions | | Concurrency  | 
+-------------------+ +-----------+  ^  +------------------------+ +--------------+ 
Layer 3:   ^                ^        ^              ^               ^      ^
+-------------------+  +-------------^-+        +----------------------+   ^  
| Generic Protocols |<-| External      |        | Memory Management    |   ^  
+-------------------+  +---------------+        +----------------------+   ^  
Layer 4:    ^               ^                                              ^
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Let's break these down:
Layer 1:
- [[REQ-app]]: The **Application Layer** (AL) is where the user creates their programs

Layer 2:
- [[REQ-com]]: The **Communication Layer** is a high level APIs for
  communicating with other programmable devices/computers through protocols
  like MQTT or HTTP/JSON-RPC.
- [[REQ-board]]: The **Board API Layer** provides an API for the specific board
  features including GPIO, peripherals, sensors, etc.
- [[REQ-std]]: The **Data Types / Functions Layer** provides ready data types
  and functions for a range of issues including buffering, serializing,
  computation, data validation, etc. It's like the standard library of
  microcontroller development.
- [[REQ-concurrency]]: The **Concurrency Layer** provides an API for performing
  actions concurrently. It depends on the Memory Management Layer for sharing
  data between threads.

Layer 3:
- [[REQ-protocols]]: The **Generic Protocols Layer** provides a socket-like API
  to the various hardware protocols (ethernet, I2C, SPI, CAN, etc). Also may
  depend on the External Layer
- [[REQ-external]]: The **External Layer** provides device-specific APIs for
  external peripherals including temperature sensors, memory/storage,
  communication, etc.
- [[REQ-mem]]: The **Memory Management Layer** provides data structures and libraries for
  managing memory including sharing between threads, global buffers, and memory
  allocation.

Layer 4:
- [[REQ-hal]]: the hardware abstraction layer provides data structues for safely interfacing
  directly with any device's registers. 
'''

[REQ-app]
text = '''
The application layer is where a user creates their programs. Creating programs
can be productive only because of all the other layers in the ecosystem, so the
design experience of this layer must be well specified.

The most basic requirement of this layer is that it should feel, as much as possible,
like programming for non-embedded rust. The only differences being:
- slightly different library
- tighter constraints (around memory, cpu-usage, etc).

That's it! Ideally the layers below this will offer data types and libraries
that will give a developer of embedded devices much the same workflow as a
developer of non-embedded devices.
'''

[REQ-com]
text = '''
The communications layer has the goal of making it easy to coordinate multiple
devices with any number of computers. These include making it easy to:
- publish/stream data to those who want it
- receive commands (micro RPC)
- log errors

In addition, the communications layer should work over a range of masterless
protocols including TCP/IP, ZigBee, UART, and CAN.

Communication is critical to embedded systems, as many such systems employ tens
or even hundreds of devies all performing monitoring and control functions
simultaniously. Such systems need to be fault tolerant and highly reliable.
'''

[REQ-board]
text = '''
Perhaps one of the most well developed embedded APIs to date as been the
API around the Arduino development board. This requirement aims to emulate
and improve upon the kind of API which Arduino spearheaded.

The Board Layer should provide a simple and safe API to all board peripherals,
preventing the user from making horrendous mistakes (i.e. sourcing an I2C
line) and giving them mappings to access the board's external device's
libraries. 
'''

[REQ-std]
text = '''
Provide a standard-library like experience for the embedded space. This means
providing ready data types and functions for:
- buffering: creating global buffers and sharing them with functions and
  between threads.
- serialzing: serializing data with low overhead marshalling and validation of
  types. 
- computation: lightweight mathematics libraries
- data validation: lightweight hash, encryption and crc algorithms
'''

[REQ-concurrency]
text = '''
Provide concurrency primitives and APIs for the embedded space, including
utilizing interrupts.

The concurrency API should be leveragable by other libraries (like
communication) with minimal boiler plate.
